    return df
#id_vars=['product'] specifies that the 'product' column should be kept as is and not reshaped.
#var_name='quarter' specifies that the variable column (previously 'quarter_1', 'quarter_2', etc.) should be renamed to 'quarter' in the resulting DataFrame.
#value_name='sales' specifies that the value column (previously containing the sales data) should be renamed to 'sales' in the resulting DataFrame.
